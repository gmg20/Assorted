### Gordon's Portfolio

Welcome! Calling this a portfolio is probably a stretch at this stage, but basically this is a compilation of some of the various Machine Learning algorithms and projects I have worked with thus far. Currently I have only uploaded Python-based projects, but I have also worked extensively with the same algorithms and models in R. I also have some MCMC-based Bayesian Model Averaging algorithms I'm working on currently that I will upload here periodically.
